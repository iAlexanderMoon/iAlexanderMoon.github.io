## Welcome
Hi, my name is Ian. I have been interested in computers since an Apple ][e was brought home to us in 1984.
I've always enjoyed __making__ and __discovery__ to which computers are nearly an endless playground.

I've made a career of being a software developer, although for better and for worse, it's no longer my primary 
responsibility. I would have called myself a fullstack developer, architect, and part-time system 
administrator. Mostly Windows at work and linux at home.

__Vi(m) is the one true text editor.__


I'm currently running a [Univeral Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) custom 
image with [Labwc](https://labwc.github.io/) which makes me a __Modern day gray beard hipster longing for the old days__.

I've always make notes and logs. To be less be less of a __Dark Matter Developer__, this site is an effort to 
share for anyone who's interested. [Docs](docs/) should cover knowledge, often the result of discovery covered in a blog [post](posts/).
